## Project Report Iteration 1

## Reflection
This project I did not really have a lot of time this week, this is seen in the project as it is extreamly bare bones. But I did learn a bit about one way collsions and how to create your own physics. I actually really enjoyed learning how to apply what I learned in physics, I applied my understanding on gravity and velocity to create a decent feeling jump action. 

### Self-Assessment
- [X] D-1: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file in its top-level directory.
- [X] D-2: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
- [X] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, in our course organization, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file, no unnecessary files tracked, and all commit messages following <a href="https://cbea.ms/git-commit/">our commit message style guide</a>.
- [X] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [X] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file, and you have satisfied all license requirements.
- [X] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game.
- [X] C-5: The game includes a player-controlled character, implemented as a <code>KinematicBody2D</code> and positioned in a conventional, <code>TileMap</code>-based, 2D-platforming world.
- [X] C-6: The player's character can move left and right, with its movement bounded by impassable tiles.
- [X] C-7: The player's character can jump up and onto tiles.
- [X] C-8: The player's character falls down when walking off a ledge.
- [X] B-1: The project report is complete.

- [X] B-3: There is a sprite element in the level that the player can interact with, such as a collectible, an enemy, a book, or a switch.
- [X] B-4: The camera follows the character through a world that is larger than one screen.
- [X] A-1: Generate neither warnings nor errors at runtime.
- [X] A-2: Earn one star
- [ ] ⭐ Animate the main character using either <code>AnimatedSprite</code> or cutout animation
- [ ] ⭐ Include parallax scrolling in the background.
- [X] ⭐ Include tiles that can be passed in one direction, such as being able to jump up through a tile and land atop it.

Therefore this work merits an A
